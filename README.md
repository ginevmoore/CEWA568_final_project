# CEWA568_final_project
Snow hydrology analysis of the South Fork Tolt River Basin
In Collaboration with Christian Vanderhoeven at UW Civil Engineering.

This repository contains tools and a test-case analysis for investigating changes in the snowpack and downstream hydrologic effects over the last 20 years using Snotel and USGS stream gage data.

The primary table of our final results is listed in tables/tolt_with_date_differences.csv

See workflow for this study, along with a generalized workflow that can be applied to similar problems, in /final_report_figures/CEWA_568_final_workflow.pdf
